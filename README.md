## Why you chose the technology you did to build the component

Boootstrap is used for responsive design 

angularjs is used for data-binding to the front end to display the data

fontello is used to display the checkmark icon

### Your thought process behind the structure of the component

index.html for the main landing page.  

Creating a lib directory to store third party plugins/tools (angular, bootsrap, ,jquery, fontello)

data direcotry to store the json data needed to be displayed on the front end

css directory to store the stylesheets needed for the app

script directory to store custom javascript code 


```
